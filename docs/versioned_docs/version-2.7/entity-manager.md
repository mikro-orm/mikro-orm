## Persist and flush

There are 2 methods we should first describe to understand how persisting works in MikroORM: `em.persist()` and `em.flush()`.

`em.persist(entity, flush?: boolean)` is used to mark new entities for future persisting. It will make the entity managed by given `EntityManager` and once `flush` will be called, it will be written to the database. Second boolean parameter can be used to invoke `flush` immediately. Its default value is configurable via `autoFlush` option.

To understand `flush`, lets first define what managed entity is: An entity is managed if itâ€™s fetched from the database (via `em.find()`, `em.findOne()` or via other managed entity) or registered as new through `em.persist()`.

`em.flush()` will go through all managed entities, compute appropriate change sets and perform according database queries. As an entity loaded from database becomes managed automatically, you do not have to call persist on those, and flush is enough to update them.

## Persisting and cascading

To save entity state to database, you need to persist it. Persist determines whether to use `insert` or `update` and computes appropriate change-set. Entity references that are not persisted yet (does not have identifier) will be cascade persisted automatically.

```typescript
// use constructors in your entities for required parameters
const author = new Author('Jon Snow', 'snow@wall.st');
author.born = new Date();

const publisher = new Publisher('7K publisher');

const book1 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 1', author);
book1.publisher = publisher;
const book2 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 2', author);
book2.publisher = publisher;
const book3 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 3', author);
book3.publisher = publisher;

// just persist books, author and publisher will be automatically cascade persisted
await orm.em.persistAndFlush([book1, book2, book3]);

// or one by one
orm.em.persistLater(book1);
orm.em.persistLater(book2);
orm.em.persistLater(book3);
await orm.em.flush(); // flush everything to database at once
```

### Auto flushing

By default, `EntityManager.persist()` will **flush your changes automatically**. You can use its second parameter to disable auto-flushing, and use `EntityManager.flush()` manually.

You can also disable this feature globally via `autoFlush` option when initializing the ORM:

```typescript
const orm = await MikroORM.init({
  autoFlush: false,
  // ...
});
await orm.em.persist(new Entity()); // no auto-flushing now
await orm.em.flush();
await orm.em.persist(new Entity(), true); // you can still use second parameter to auto-flush
```

> Default value of `autoFlush` is currently set to `true`, which will change in upcoming major release. Users are encouraged to either set `autoFlush` to `false` or use `em.persistLater()` (equal to `em.persist(entity, false)`) and `em.persistAndFlush()` methods instead.

## Fetching entities with EntityManager

To fetch entities from database you can use `find()` and `findOne()` of `EntityManager`:

Example:

```typescript
const author = await orm.em.findOne(Author, '...id...');
const books = await orm.em.find(Book, {});

for (const author of authors) {
  console.log(author.name); // Jon Snow

  for (const book of author.books) {
    console.log(book.title); // initialized
    console.log(book.author.isInitialized()); // true
    console.log(book.author.id);
    console.log(book.author.name); // Jon Snow
    console.log(book.publisher); // just reference
    console.log(book.publisher.isInitialized()); // false
    console.log(book.publisher.id);
    console.log(book.publisher.name); // undefined
  }
}
```

### Fetching partial entities

When fetching single entity, you can choose to select only parts of an entity via `options.fields`:

```typescript
const author = await orm.em.findOne(Author, '...', { fields: ['name', 'born'] });
console.log(author.id); // PK is always selected
console.log(author.name); // Jon Snow
console.log(author.email); // undefined
```

## Type of fetched entities

Both `EntityManager.find` and `EntityManager.findOne()` methods have generic return types. All of following examples are equal and will let typescript correctly infer the entity type:

```typescript
const author1 = await orm.em.findOne<Author>(Author.name, '...id...');
const author2 = await orm.em.findOne<Author>('Author', '...id...');
const author3 = await orm.em.findOne(Author, '...id...');
```

As the last one is the least verbose, it should be preferred.

## Entity repositories

Although you can use `EntityManager` directly, much more convenient way is to use [`EntityRepository` instead](https://mikro-orm.io/repositories/). You can register your repositories in dependency injection container like [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) so you do not need to get them from `EntityManager` each time.

For more examples, take a look at [`tests/EntityManager.mongo.test.ts`](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/blob/master/tests/EntityManager.mongo.test.ts) or [`tests/EntityManager.mysql.test.ts`](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/blob/master/tests/EntityManager.mysql.test.ts).

## EntityManager API

#### `getRepository<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>): EntityRepository<T>`

Returns `EntityRepository` for given entity, respects `customRepository` option of `@Entity` and `entityRepository` option of `MikroORM.init()`.

#### `find<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, where?: FilterQuery<T>, options?: FindOptions): Promise<T[]>`

Returns array of entities found for given condition. You can specify `FindOptions` to request population of referenced entities or control the pagination:

```typescript
export interface FindOptions {
  populate?: string[];
  orderBy?: { [k: string]: QueryOrder };
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}
```

---

#### `find<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, where?: FilterQuery<T>, populate?: string[], orderBy?: { [k: string]: QueryOrder }, limit?: number, offset?: number): Promise<T[]>`

Same as previous `find` method, just with dedicated parameters for `populate`, `orderBy`, `limit` and `offset`.

---

#### `findOne<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, where: FilterQuery<T> | string, populate?: string[]): Promise<T | null>`

Finds an entity by given `where` condition. You can use primary key as `where` value, then if the entity is already managed, no database call will be made.

---

#### `merge<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, data: EntityData<T>): T`

Adds given entity to current Identity Map. After merging, entity becomes managed. This is useful when you want to work with cached entities.

---

#### `map<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, data: EntityData<T>): T`

Maps raw DB result to entity, adding it to current Identity Map. Equivalent to `IDatabaseDriver.mapResult()` followed by `EntityManager.merge()`.

---

#### `getReference<T extends IEntity>(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, id: string): T`

Gets a reference to the entity identified by the given type and identifier without actually loading it, if the entity is not yet loaded.

---

#### `count(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, where: any): Promise<number>`

Gets count of entities matching the `where` condition.

---

#### `persist(entity: IEntity | IEntity[], flush?: boolean): Promise<void>`

Tells the EntityManager to make an instance managed and persistent. The entity will be entered into the database at or before transaction commit or as a result of the flush operation. You can control immediate flushing via `flush` parameter and via `autoFlush` configuration option.

---

#### `persistAndFlush(entity: IEntity | IEntity[]): Promise<void>`

Shortcut for `persist` & `flush`.

---

#### `persistLater(entity: IEntity | IEntity[]): void`

Shortcut for just `persist`, without flushing.

---

#### `flush(): Promise<void>`

Flushes all changes to objects that have been queued up to now to the database.

---

#### `remove(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, where: IEntity | any, flush?: boolean): Promise<number>`

When provided entity instance as `where` value, then it calls `removeEntity(entity, flush)`, otherwise it fires delete query with given `where` condition.

This method fires `beforeDelete` and `afterDelete` hooks only if you provide entity instance.

---

#### `removeEntity(entity: IEntity, flush?: boolean): Promise<number>`

Removes an entity instance. A removed entity will be removed from the database at or before transaction commit or as a result of the flush operation. You can control immediate flushing via `flush` parameter and via `autoFlush` configuration option.

This method fires `beforeDelete` and `afterDelete` hooks.

---

#### `removeAndFlush(entity: IEntity): Promise<void>`

Shortcut for `removeEntity` & `flush`.

---

#### `removeLater(entity: IEntity): void`

Shortcut for `removeEntity` without flushing.

---

#### `clear(): void`

Clears the EntityManager. All entities that are currently managed by this EntityManager become detached.

---

#### `canPopulate(entityName: string | EntityClass<T>, property: string): boolean`

Returns whether given entity has given property which can be populated (is reference or collection).
