## TODO

- [ ] soft delete via `onFlush` event - show on comments
- [ ] test `Rel<T>` type with ESM and reflect-metadata, use code tabs for both? the ts-morph setup would be optional with a "skip" link at the top
- [ ] add note about existing database and entity generator
- [ ] cascading and propagation
- [ ] default values
- [ ] example how to go about scripts (forking or allowing global context) and CRON jobs (request context decorator or explicit helper usage)
