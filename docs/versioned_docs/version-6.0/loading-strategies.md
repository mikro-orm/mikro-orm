title: Relationship Loading Strategies

MikroORM supports two loading strategies:

- `select-in` which uses separate queries for each relation - it you populate two relations, you will get three queries - one for the root entity, and one for each populated relation.
- `joined` which uses a single query and joins the relations instead.

> `joined` strategy is supported **only in SQL drivers** and is the **default** for those since v6.

## Configuring the strategy

The loading strategy can be specified both at mapping time and when loading entities, as well as globally in your ORM config.

Given the following entities:

```ts
import { Entity, LoadStrategy, OneToMany, ManyToOne, PrimaryKey } from '@mikro-orm/core';

@Entity()
export class Author {

  @PrimaryKey()
  id!: number;

  @OneToMany(() => Book, b => b.author)
  books = new Collection<Book>(this);

}

@Entity()
export class Book {

  @PrimaryKey()
  id!: number;

  @ManyToOne()
  author: Author;

}
```

With the default `joined` strategy, this will issue a single query both the `Author` entity and its `books` relation.

```ts
const author = await orm.em.findOne(Author, 1, {
  populate: ['books'],
});
```

To override the strategy, you can use the `strategy` option:

```ts
const author = await orm.em.findOne(Author, 1, {
  populate: ['books'],
  strategy: 'select-in',
});
```

This will issue two SQL statements, one to load the author and another to load all the books belonging to that author:

Alternatively, you can control the strategy in your entity definition.

```ts
import { Entity, LoadStrategy, OneToMany } from '@mikro-orm/core';

@Entity()
export class Author {

  // ...

  @OneToMany({
    entity: () => Book,
    mappedBy: b => b.author,
    strategy: 'select-in', // force select-in strategy for this relation
  })
  books = new Collection<Book>(this);

}
```

The strategy defined on property level will always take a precedence.

## Changing the loading strategy globally

You can use `loadStrategy` option in the ORM config:

```ts
MikroORM.init({
  // ...
  populate: ['books'],
  loadStrategy: 'select-in', // 'joined' is the default for SQL drivers
});
```

This value will be used as the default, specifying the loading strategy on property level has precedence, as well as specifying it in the `FindOptions`.

## Population `where` condition

The where condition is by default applied only to the root entity. This can be controlled via `populateWhere` option. It accepts one of `all` (default), `infer` (use same condition as the `where` query) or an explicit filter query.

```ts
await em.find(Author, { ... }, {
  populate: ['books'],
  populateWhere: 'infer', // defaults to `all`

  // or specify custom query, will be used via `join on` conditions
  // populateWhere: { age: { $gte: 18 } },
});
```

> `populateWhere` can be also set globally, the default is `all`.

## Population `order by` clause

Similarly to the `populateWhere`, you can also control the `order by` clause used for the populate queries. The default behaviour is to use the same ordering as for the root entity, and you can use `populateOrderBy` option to add a different ordering:

```ts
await em.find(Author, { ... }, {
  populate: ['books'],
  populateOrderBy: { books: { publishedAt: 'desc' } },
});
```
