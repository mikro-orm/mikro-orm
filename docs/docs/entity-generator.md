title: Entity Generator
---

To generate entities from existing database schema, you can use the `EntityGenerator` helper. It lives in its own package called `@mikro-orm/entity-generator`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mikro-orm/entity-generator
```

> The version needs to be aligned with the `@mikro-orm/core` package and the database driver package.

To use it, you need to register the `EntityGenerator` extension in your ORM config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@mikro-orm/postgresql';
import { EntityGenerator } from '@mikro-orm/entity-generator';

export default defineConfig({
  dbName: 'test',
  extensions: [EntityGenerator],
});
```

Then you can use it either via CLI:

> To work with the CLI, first install `@mikro-orm/cli` package locally. The version needs to be aligned with the `@mikro-orm/core` package.

```sh
npx mikro-orm generate-entities --dump  # Dumps all generated entities
npx mikro-orm generate-entities --save --path=./my-entities  # Saves entities into given directory
```

Or you can create simple script where you initialize MikroORM like this:

```ts title="./generate-entities.ts"
import { MikroORM } from '@mikro-orm/core';
import { EntityGenerator } from '@mikro-orm/entity-generator';

(async () => {
  const orm = await MikroORM.init({
    discovery: {
      // we need to disable validation for no entities
      warnWhenNoEntities: false,
      extensions: [EntityGenerator],
    },
    dbName: 'your-db-name',
    // ...
  });
  const dump = await orm.entityGenerator.generate({
    save: true,
    path: process.cwd() + '/my-entities',
  });
  console.log(dump);
  await orm.close(true);
})();
```

Then run this script via `ts-node` (or compile it to plain JS and use `node`):

```sh
$ ts-node generate-entities
```

## Advanced configuration

The behaviour of the entity generator can be adjusted either via `entityGenerator` section in the ORM config, or with the `GenerateOptions` object (parameter of the `generate` method), which takes precedence over the global configuration.

Available options:

Example configuration:

  identifiedReferences: true,
  esmImport: true,
  save: true,

  skipTables: ['book', 'author'],
  skipColumns: {
    'public.user': ['email', 'middle_name'],
  },
});

## Processing of generated metadata

There are several features that are impossible to infer from the database schema alone.

The configuration settings `onInitialMetadata` and `onProcessedMetadata` can be used to add that information to the generated metadata, before the metadata is ultimately saved as a file. Note that this is different from the `onMetadata` hook in the configuration. The `onMetadata` hook does not affect the entity files, but those in the generator options do.

Some of the things that are suitable for these hooks include

- Adding the `hidden` flag on certain columns and relations.
- Adding the `lazy` flag on certain columns.
- Adding the `eager` flag on certain relations.
- Adding the `mapToPk` flag on certain relations.
- Adding the `orphanRemoval` flag on certain inverse relations.
- Adding the `cascade` option on certain relations.
- Tweaking the `type` of JSON columns to a specific (inline defined) shape.
- Adding Single Table Inheritance definitions.
- Adding `@Embedded` entities and references to them.
- Adding `virtual` entities.
- Adding properties with `formula`.

Here's an example that will make any column named "password" (regardless of what table is defined in) be lazy and hidden in its `onInitialMetadata` and in `onProcessedMetadata` will make all ManyToMany relations be hidden.

```ts
import { ReferenceKind } from '@mikro-orm/core';

await orm.entityGenerator.generate({
  onInitialMetadata: (metadata, platform) => {
    metadata.forEach(meta => {
      meta.props.forEach(prop => {
        if (prop.name === 'password') {
          prop.hidden = true;
          prop.lazy = true;
        }
      });
    });
  },
  onProcessedMetadata: (metadata, platform) => {
    metadata.forEach(meta => {
      meta.props.forEach(prop => {
        if (prop.kind === ReferenceKind.MANY_TO_MANY) {
          prop.hidden = true;
        }
      });
    });
  },
});
```

Adding embedded and virtual entities via the hooks can be somewhat tricky. The metadata objects are internal, and thus fewer checks are in place on them.

Here's an example that defines a simple embeddable with just two properties and adds a reference to it that is otherwise known to be a JSON column.

```ts
import { ReferenceKind } from '@mikro-orm/core';

await orm.entityGenerator.generate({
  onInitialMetadata: (metadata, platform) => {
    const embeddableEntityMeta = new EntityMetadata({
      className: 'IdentitiesContainer',
      collection: platform.getConfig().getNamingStrategy().classToTableName('IdentitiesContainer'),
      embeddable: true,
    });
    embeddableEntityMeta.addProperty({
      name: 'github',
      type: 'string',
      nullable: true,
      fieldNames: ['github'],
      columnTypes: ['varchar(255)'],
    });
    embeddableEntityMeta.addProperty({
      name: 'local',
      type: 'number',
      nullable: true,
      fieldNames: ['local'],
      columnTypes: ['int'],
    });
    metadata.push(embeddableEntityMeta);

    const identitiesPropOnAuthor = metadata.find(meta => meta.className === 'Author')!.properties.identities;
    identitiesPropOnAuthor.kind = ReferenceKind.EMBEDDED;
    identitiesPropOnAuthor.object = true;
    identitiesPropOnAuthor.type = 'IdentitiesContainer';
  },
});
```

An alternative approach is to define the embedded entities manually. The generator's metadata hooks only need to add the references to these embedded entities.

## Current limitations

- In MySQL, `TINYINT(1)` columns will be defined as boolean properties. There is no true `BOOLEAN` type in MySQL (the keyword is just an alias for `TINYINT(1)`).
- MongoDB is not supported.
