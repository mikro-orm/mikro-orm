> SchemaGenerator can do harm to your database. It will drop or alter tables, indexes, 
> sequences and such. Please use this tool with caution in development and not on a 
> production server. It is meant for helping you develop your Database Schema, but NOT 
> with migrating schema from A to B in production. A safe approach would be generating 
> the SQL on development server and saving it into SQL Migration files that are executed 
> manually on the production server.

> SchemaTool assumes your project uses the given database on its own. Update and Drop 
> commands will mess with other tables if they are not related to the current project 
> that is using MikroORM. Please be careful!

To generate schema from your entity metadata, you can use `SchemaGenerator` helper. 

You can use it via CLI: 

```sh
npx mikro-orm schema:create --dump   # Dumps create schema SQL
npx mikro-orm schema:update --dump   # Dumps update schema SQL
npx mikro-orm schema:drop --dump     # Dumps drop schema SQL 
```

> You can also use `--run` flag to fire all queries, but be careful as it might break your
> database. Be sure to always check the generated SQL first before executing. Do not use
> `--run` flag in production! 

`schema:create` will automatically create the database if it does not exist. 

`schema:update` drops all unknown tables by default, you can use `--no-drop-tables` 
to get around it. There is also `--safe` flag that will disable both table dropping as 
well as column dropping. 

`schema:drop` will by default drop all database tables. You can use `--drop-db` flag to drop
the whole database instead. 

```shell
npx mikro-orm schema:fresh --run     # !WARNING! Drops the database schema and recreates it
```
This command can be run with the `--seed` option to seed the database after it has been created again.
```shell
npx mikro-orm schema:fresh --run --seed              # seed the database with the default database seeder
npx mikro-orm schema:fresh --run --seed=UsersSeeder  # seed the database with the UsersSeeder
```
> You can specify the default database seeder in the orm config with the key `config.seeder.defaultSeeder`

## Using SchemaGenerator programmatically

Or you can create simple script where you initialize MikroORM like this:

```typescript title="./create-schema.ts"
import { MikroORM } from '@mikro-orm/core';

(async () => {
  const orm = await MikroORM.init({
    entities: [Author, Book, ...],
    dbName: 'your-db-name',
    // ...
  });
  const generator = orm.getSchemaGenerator();

  const dropDump = await generator.getDropSchemaSQL();
  console.log(dropDump);

  const createDump = await generator.getCreateSchemaSQL();
  console.log(createDump);

  const updateDump = await generator.getUpdateSchemaSQL();
  console.log(updateDump);

  // there is also `generate()` method that returns drop + create queries
  const dropAndCreateDump = await generator.generate();
  console.log(dropAndCreateDump);

  // or you can run those queries directly, but be sure to check them first!
  await generator.dropSchema();
  await generator.createSchema();
  await generator.updateSchema();

  await orm.close(true);
})();
```

Then run this script via `ts-node` (or compile it to plain JS and use `node`):

```sh
$ ts-node create-schema
```

## Limitations of SQLite

There are limitations of SQLite database because of which it behaves differently 
than other SQL drivers. Namely, it is not possible to:

- create foreign key constraints when altering columns
- create empty tables without columns
- alter column requires nullability

Because of this, you can end up with different schema with SQLite, so it is not
suggested to use SQLite for integration tests of your application.
