## Persist and Flush

There are 2 methods you should first understand to learn how persisting works in MikroORM: `em.persist()` and `em.flush()`.

`em.persist(entity)` is used to mark new entities for future persisting. It will make the entity managed by given `EntityManager` and once `flush` will be called, it will be written to the database.

To understand `flush`, lets first define what managed entity is: An entity is managed if it’s fetched from the database (via `em.find()`, `em.findOne()` or via other managed entity) or registered as new through `em.persist()`.

`em.flush()` will go through all managed entities, compute appropriate change sets and perform according database queries. As an entity loaded from database becomes managed automatically, you do not have to call persist on those, and flush is enough to update them.

```ts
const book = await em.findOne(Book, 1);
book.title = 'How to persist things...';

// no need to persist `book` as its already managed by the EM
await em.flush();
```

## Persisting and Cascading

To save entity state to database, you need to persist it. Persist determines whether to use `insert` or `update` and computes appropriate change-set. Entity references that are not persisted yet (does not have identifier) will be cascade persisted automatically.

```ts
// use constructors in your entities for required parameters
const author = new Author('Jon Snow', 'snow@wall.st');
author.born = new Date();

const publisher = new Publisher('7K publisher');

const book1 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 1', author);
book1.publisher = publisher;
const book2 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 2', author);
book2.publisher = publisher;
const book3 = new Book('My Life on The Wall, part 3', author);
book3.publisher = publisher;

// just persist books, author and publisher will be automatically cascade persisted
await em.persist([book1, book2, book3]).flush();

// or one by one
em.persist(book1);
em.persist(book2);
em.persist(book3);
await em.flush(); // flush everything to database at once
```

## Entity references

MikroORM represents every entity as an object, even those that are not fully loaded. Those are called entity references - they are in fact regular entity class instances, but only with their primary key available. This makes it possible to create them without querying the database. References are stored in the identity map just like any other entity.

```ts
const userRef = em.getReference(User, 1);
console.log(userRef);
```

This will log something like `(User) { id: 1 }`, note the class name being wrapped in parens - this tells you the entity is not-initialized state and represents just the primary key.

Here is an example of common actions you can do with a reference instead of a fully loaded entity:

```ts
// setting relation properties
author.favouriteBook = em.getReference(Book, 1);

// removing entity by reference
em.remove(em.getReference(Book, 2));

// adding entity to collection by reference
author.books.add(em.getReference(Book, 3));
```

The concept can be combined with the so-called `Reference` wrapper for added type safety as described in the [Type-safe Relations section](type-safe-relations.md).

## Entity state and `WrappedEntity`

During entity discovery (which happens when you call `MikroORM.init()`), the ORM will patch the entity prototype and generate a lazy getter for the `WrappedEntity` - a class holding various metadata and state information about the entity. Each entity instance will have one, available under a hidden `__helper` property - to access its API in a type-safe way, use the `wrap()` helper:

```ts
import { wrap } from '@mikro-orm/core';

const userRef = em.getReference(User, 1);
console.log('userRef is initialized:', wrap(userRef).isInitialized()); // false

await wrap(userRef).init();
console.log('userRef is initialized:', wrap(userRef).isInitialized()); // true
```

> You can also extend the `BaseEntity` provided by MikroORM. It defines all the public methods available via `wrap()` helper, so you could do `userRef.isInitialized()` or `userRef.init()`.

The `WrappedEntity` instance also holds the state of the entity at the time it was loaded or flushed - this state is then used by the Unit of Work during flush to compute the differences. Another use case is serialization, you can use the `toObject()`, `toPOJO()` and `toJSON()` methods to convert the entity instance to a plain JavaScript object.

## Removing entities

To delete entities via `EntityManager`, you have two possibilities:

1. Mark entity instance via `em.remove()` - this means you first need to have the entity instance. But don't worry, you can get one even without loading it from the database - via `em.getReference()`.
2. Fire `DELETE` query via `em.nativeDelete()` - when all you want is a simple delete query, it can be simple as that.

Let's test the first approach with removing by entity instance:

```ts
// using reference is enough, no need for a fully initialized entity
const book1 = em.getReference(Book, 1);
await em.remove(book1).flush();
```

## Fetching Entities with EntityManager

To fetch entities from database you can use `em.find()` and `em.findOne()`:

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, 123);
const books = await em.find(Book, {});

for (const author of authors) {
  console.log(author.name); // Jon Snow

  for (const book of author.books) {
    console.log(book.title); // initialized
    console.log(book.author.isInitialized()); // true
    console.log(book.author.id);
    console.log(book.author.name); // Jon Snow
    console.log(book.publisher); // just reference
    console.log(book.publisher.isInitialized()); // false
    console.log(book.publisher.id);
    console.log(book.publisher.name); // undefined
  }
}
```

Alternatively, there is also `em.findAll()`, which does not have the second `where` parameter and defaults to returning all entities. You can still use the `where` option of this method though:

```ts
const books = await em.findAll(Book, {
  where: { publisher: { $ne: null } }, // optional
});
```

To populate entity relations, you can use `populate` parameter.

```ts
const books = await em.findAll(Book, {
  where: { publisher: { $ne: null } },
  // highlight-next-line
  populate: ['author.friends'],
});
```

You can also use `em.populate()` helper to populate relations (or to ensure they are fully populated) on already loaded entities. This is also handy when loading entities via `QueryBuilder`:

```ts
const authors = await em.createQueryBuilder(Author).select('*').getResult();
await em.populate(authors, ['books.tags']);

// now the Author entities will have `books` collections populated,
// as well as they will have their `tags` collections populated.
console.log(authors[0].books[0].tags[0]); // initialized BookTag
```

### Conditions Object (`FilterQuery<T>`)

Querying entities via conditions object (`where` in `em.find(Entity, where: FilterQuery<T>)`) supports many different ways:

```ts
// search by entity properties
const users = await em.find(User, { firstName: 'John' });

// for searching by reference we can use primary key directly
const id = 1;
const users = await em.find(User, { organization: id });

// or pass unpopulated reference (including `Reference` wrapper)
const ref = await em.getReference(Organization, id);
const users = await em.find(User, { organization: ref });

// fully populated entities as also supported
const ent = await em.findOne(Organization, id);
const users = await em.find(User, { organization: ent });

// complex queries with operators
const users = await em.find(User, { $and: [{ id: { $nin: [3, 4] } }, { id: { $gt: 2 } }] });

// we can also search for array of primary keys directly
const users = await em.find(User, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// and in findOne all of this works, plus we can search by single primary key
const user1 = await em.findOne(User, 1);
```

As you can see in the fifth example, you can also use operators like `$and`, `$or`, `$gte`, `$gt`, `$lte`, `$lt`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$like`, `$re` and `$fulltext`. More about that can be found in [Query Conditions](./query-conditions.md) section.

#### Using custom classes in `FilterQuery`

If you decide to abstract the filter options in your own object then you might run into the problem that the find option does not return the results you'd expect. This is due to the fact that the `FilterQuery` should be provided as a plain object (POJO), and not a class instance with prototype.

If you want to provide your own `FilterQuery` DTO, then your DTO class should extend the `PlainObject` class. This way MikroORM knows it should be treated as such.

```ts
import { PlainObject } from '@mikro-orm/core';

class Filter extends PlainObject {
  name: string;
}

const where = new Filter();
where.name = 'Jon';
const res = await em.find(Author, where);
```

#### Mitigating `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.ts(2589)` error

Sometimes you might be facing TypeScript errors caused by too complex query for it to properly infer all types. Usually it can be solved by providing the type argument explicitly.

You can also opt in to use repository instead, as there the type inference should not be problematic.

> As a last resort, you can always type cast the query to `any`.

```ts
const books = await em.find<Book>(Book, { ... our complex query ... });
// or
const books = await em.getRepository(Book).find({ ... our complex query ... });
// or
const books = await em.find<any>(Book, { ... our complex query ... }) as Book[];
```

Another problem you might be facing is `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error thrown during TypeScript compilation (usually from file `node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js`). The solution to this is the same, just provide the type argument explicitly.

### Searching by referenced entity fields

You can also search by referenced entity properties. Simply pass nested where condition like this and all requested relationships will be automatically joined. Currently, it will only join them so you can search and sort by those. To populate entities, do not forget to pass the populate parameter as well.

```ts
// find author of a book that has tag specified by name
const author = await em.findOne(Author, { books: { tags: { name: 'Tag name' } } });
console.log(author.books.isInitialized()); // false, as it only works for query and sort

const author = await em.findOne(Author, { books: { tags: { name: 'Tag name' } } }, { populate: ['books.tags'] });
console.log(author.books.isInitialized()); // true, because it was populated
console.log(author.books[0].tags.isInitialized()); // true, because it was populated
console.log(author.books[0].tags[0].isInitialized()); // true, because it was populated
```

> This feature is fully available only for SQL drivers. In MongoDB you always need to query from the owning side - so in the example above, first load book tag by name, then associated book, then the author. Another option is to denormalize the schema.

### Partial loading

To fetch only some database columns, you can use the `fields` option:

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, '...', {
  fields: ['name', 'born'],
});
console.log(author.id); // PK is always selected
console.log(author.name); // Jon Snow
console.log(author.email); // undefined
```

This works also for nested relations:

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, '...', {
  fields: ['name', 'books.title', 'books.author', 'books.price'],
});
```

Primary keys are always selected even if you omit them. On the other hand, you are responsible for selecting the foreign keys—if you omit such property, the relation might not be loaded properly. In the following example the books would not be linked the author, because you did not specify the `books.author` field to be loaded.

```ts
// this will load both author and book entities, but they won't be connected due to the missing FK in select
const author = await em.findOne(Author, '...', {
  fields: ['name', 'books.title', 'books.price'],
});
```

> The Same problem can occur in mongo with M:N collections—those are stored as array property on the owning entity, so you need to make sure to mark such properties too.

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, '...', {
  fields: ['name', 'books.title', 'books.author', 'books.price'],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `exclude` option, which will omit the provided properties and select everything else:

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, '...', {
  exclude: ['email', 'books.price'],
  populate: ['books'], // unlike with `fields`, you need to explicitly populate the relation here
});
```

### Fetching Paginated Results

If you are going to paginate your results, you can use `em.findAndCount()` that will return total count of entities before applying limit and offset.

```ts
const [authors, count] = await em.findAndCount(Author, { ... }, { limit: 10, offset: 50 });
console.log(authors.length); // based on limit parameter, e.g. 10
console.log(count); // total count, e.g. 1327
```

### Cursor-based pagination

As an alternative to the offset based pagination with `limit` and `offset`, you can paginate based on a cursor. A cursor is an opaque string that defines specific place in ordered entity graph. You can use `em.findByCursor()` to access those options. Under the hood, it will call `em.find()` and `em.count()` just like the `em.findAndCount()` method, but will use the cursor options instead.

Supports `before`, `after`, `first` and `last` options while disallowing `limit` and `offset`. Explicit `orderBy` option is required. It also supports the `includeCount` (default to true) option. When explicitly set to false, entity manager will perform a `find` instead of `findAndCount`. The cursor `totalCount` will be set to null instead. This can be used as a performance optimization to avoid an expensive SQL count query, when knowing the exact number of pages is not important.

Use `first` and `after` for forward pagination, or `last` and `before` for backward pagination.

- `first` and `last` are numbers and serve as an alternative to `offset`, those options are mutually exclusive, use only one at a time
- `before` and `after` specify the previous cursor value, it can be one of the:
    - `Cursor` instance
    - opaque string provided by `startCursor/endCursor` properties
    - POJO/entity instance

```ts
const currentCursor = await em.findByCursor(User, {
  first: 10,
  after: previousCursor, // cursor instance
  orderBy: { id: 'desc' },
});

// to fetch next page
const nextCursor = await em.findByCursor(User, {
  first: 10,
  after: currentCursor.endCursor, // opaque string
  orderBy: { id: 'desc' },
});

// to fetch next page
const nextCursor2 = await em.findByCursor(User, {
  first: 10,
  after: { id: lastSeenId }, // entity-like POJO
  orderBy: { id: 'desc' },
});

const currentCursorWithoutCount = await em.findByCursor(User, {
  first: 10,
  after: previousCursor, // cursor instance
  orderBy: { id: 'desc' },
  includeCount: false,
});
```

The `Cursor` object provides following interface:

```ts
Cursor<User> {
  items: [
    User { ... },
    User { ... },
    User { ... },
    ...
  ],
  totalCount: 50, // not defined when `includeCount` is set to false
  length: 10,
  startCursor: 'WzRd',
  endCursor: 'WzZd',
  hasPrevPage: true,
  hasNextPage: true,
}
```

### Streaming

If you want to process large amount of entities without loading them all into memory at once, you can use `em.stream()` method. It returns an async iterable, so you can use it in `for await ... of` loop.

```ts
const stream = em.stream(Book, {
  populate: ['author'],
  where: { price: { $gt: 100 } },
  orderBy: { id: 'ASC' },
});

for await (const book of stream) {
  console.log(book.title);
  console.log(book.author.name);
}
```

There are several constraints when using streaming:

- Returned entities are not managed. Identity holds only for the returned entity graph.
- Joined strategy is enforced for all populated relations.
- When populating to-many relations, only fully hydrated entities will be returned.
- You should provide an `orderBy` clause to ensure consistent ordering.
- With mongodb driver, only root entities can be streamed, `populate` option is ignored.

To stream results row-by-row, use `mergeResults: false` option. In this mode, if you populate to-many relations, you will get duplicated root entities, one per each row (due to the cartesian product caused by the to-many join).

```ts
const stream = em.stream(Book, {
  populate: ['author'],
  where: { price: { $gt: 100 } },
  orderBy: { id: 'ASC' },
  mergeResults: false,
});
```

To stream raw results, use `QueryBuilder.stream()` or `driver.stream()` methods directly. Read more about this in the [Streaming guide](./streaming.md).

### Handling Not Found Entities

When you call `em.findOne()` and no entity is found based on your criteria, `null` will be returned. If you rather have an `Error` instance thrown, you can use `em.findOneOrFail()`:

```ts
const author = await em.findOne(Author, { name: 'does-not-exist' });
console.log(author === null); // true

try {
  const author = await em.findOneOrFail(Author, { name: 'does-not-exist' });
  // author will be always found here
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Not found', e);
}
```

You can customize the error either globally via `findOneOrFailHandler` option, or locally via `failHandler` option in `findOneOrFail` call.

```ts
try {
  const author = await em.findOneOrFail(Author, { name: 'does-not-exist' }, {
    failHandler: (entityName: string, where: Record<string, any> | IPrimaryKey) => new Error(`Failed: ${entityName} in ${util.inspect(where)}`)
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e); // your custom error
}
```

### Using custom SQL fragments

Any SQL fragment in your `WHERE` query or `ORDER BY` clause need to be wrapped with `raw()` or `sql`:

```ts
const users = await em.find(User, { [sql`lower(email)`]: 'foo@bar.baz' }, {
  orderBy: { [sql`(point(loc_latitude, loc_longitude) <@> point(0, 0))`]: 'ASC' },
});
```

This will produce following query:

```sql
select `e0`.*
from `user` as `e0`
where lower(email) = 'foo@bar.baz'
order by (point(loc_latitude, loc_longitude) <@> point(0, 0)) asc
```

Read more about this in [Using raw SQL query fragments](./raw-queries.md) section.

### Query Options

The `em.find()` and `em.count()` methods accept several driver-specific query options:

#### Collation

Controls string comparison rules. The `collation` option accepts different types depending on the driver:

- **SQL drivers**: Pass a collation name **string**. It will be applied as `COLLATE` to **every** column in the `ORDER BY` clause. Passing a `CollationOptions` object to a SQL driver will throw an error.
- **MongoDB**: Pass a `CollationOptions` **object**. Passing a string to MongoDB will throw an error.

```ts
// SQL: applies COLLATE to ORDER BY
const users = await em.find(User, {}, {
  collation: 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
  orderBy: { name: 'asc' },
});
// produces: ... ORDER BY `name` COLLATE `utf8mb4_general_ci` ASC

// MongoDB: structured collation object
const users = await em.find(User, {}, {
  collation: { locale: 'en', strength: 2 },
  orderBy: { name: QueryOrder.ASC },
});
```

To use collation in `WHERE` conditions (SQL only), use raw SQL fragments:

```ts
const users = await em.find(User, {
  [sql`name collate utf8mb4_general_ci`]: 'john',
});
// produces: ... WHERE name collate `utf8mb4_general_ci` = 'john'
```

For MongoDB, the `collation` option applies to the entire query (both filtering and sorting), which is the native MongoDB behavior.

#### Index Hints

For SQL, pass a string to append to the `FROM` clause. For MongoDB, pass a string (index name) or object (index spec) as a `hint` to the native driver.

```ts
// SQL
const users = await em.find(User, {}, {
  indexHint: 'force index(my_index)',
});

// MongoDB
const users = await em.find(User, {}, {
  indexHint: 'name_1', // or { name: 1 }
});
```

#### MongoDB-only Options

```ts
const users = await em.find(User, {}, {
  maxTimeMS: 5000,     // query timeout in milliseconds
  allowDiskUse: true,  // allow disk use for large sorts
});
```

## Updating references (not loaded entities)

You can update references via Unit of Work, just like if it was a loaded entity. This way it is possible to issue update queries without loading the entity.

```ts
const ref = em.getReference(Author, 123);
ref.name = 'new name';
ref.email = 'new email';
await em.flush();
```

This is a rough equivalent to calling `em.nativeUpdate()`, with one significant difference - it uses the flush operation which handles event execution, so all life cycle hooks as well as flush events will be fired.

## Atomic updates via `raw()` helper

When you want to issue an atomic update query via flush, you can use the static `raw()` helper:

```ts
const ref = em.getReference(Author, 123);
ref.age = raw<number>(`age * 2`);

await em.flush();
console.log(ref.age); // real value is available after flush
```

The `raw()` helper accepts a generic type parameter that specifies the return type. When assigning directly to entity properties, use `raw<T>()` where `T` matches the property type:

```ts
// Direct property assignment requires explicit type
author.age = raw<number>(`age + 1`);
author.name = raw<string>(`upper(name)`);
book.price = raw<number>(`price * 1.1`);
```

When using `em.create()`, `em.assign()`, or similar methods, the type parameter is not required as `RawQueryFragment` is accepted in entity data types:

```ts
// No explicit type needed with em.create/em.assign
em.assign(author, { age: raw(`age + 1`) });
const book = em.create(Book, { price: raw(`price * 1.1`) });
```

The `raw()` helper returns special raw query fragment object. It disallows serialization (via `toJSON`) as well as working with the value (via [`valueOf()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf)). Only single use of this value is allowed, if you try to reassign it to another entity, an error will be thrown to protect you from mistakes like this:

```ts
order.number = raw<number>(`(select max(num) + 1 from orders)`);
user.lastOrderNumber = order.number; // throws, it could resolve to a different value
JSON.stringify(order); // throws, raw value cannot be serialized
```

## Upsert

You can use `em.upsert()` to create or update the entity, based on whether it is already present in the database. This method performs an `insert on conflict merge` query ensuring the database is in sync, returning a managed entity instance. The method accepts either `entityName` together with the entity `data`, or just entity instance.

```ts
// insert into "author" ("age", "email") values (33, 'foo@bar.com') on conflict ("email") do update set "age" = 33
const author = await em.upsert(Author, { email: 'foo@bar.com', age: 33 });
```

The entity data needs to contain either the primary key, or any other unique property. Let's consider the following example, where `Author.email` is a unique property:

```ts
// insert into "author" ("age", "email") values (33, 'foo@bar.com') on conflict ("email") do update set "age" = 33
// select "id" from "author" where "email" = 'foo@bar.com'
const author = await em.upsert(Author, { email: 'foo@bar.com', age: 33 });
```

Depending on the driver support, this will either use a returning query, or a separate select query, to fetch the primary key if it's missing from the `data`.

You can also use detached entity instance, after the `em.upsert()` call it will become managed.

```ts
const author = em.create(Author, { email: 'foo@bar.com', age: 33 });
await em.upsert(author);
```

There is also `em.upsertMany()` with similar signature:

```ts
const [author1, author2, author3] = await em.upsertMany(Author, [
  { email: 'a1', age: 41 },
  { email: 'a2', age: 42 },
  { email: 'a3', age: 43 },
]);
```

By default, the EntityManager will prefer using the primary key, and fallback to the first unique property with a value. Sometimes this might not be the wanted behaviour, one example is when you generate the primary key via property initializer, e.g. with `uuid.v4()`. For those advanced cases, you can control how the underlying upserting logic works via the following options:

- `onConflictFields?: (keyof T)[]` to control the conflict clause
- `onConflictAction?: 'ignore' | 'merge'` used ignore and merge as that is how the QB methods are called
- `onConflictMergeFields?: (keyof T)[]` to control the merge clause
- `onConflictExcludeFields?: (keyof T)[]` to omit fields from the merge clause
- `onConflictWhere?: FilterQuery<T>` to allow conditional updates

```ts
const [author1, author2, author3] = await em.upsertMany(Author, [{ ... }, { ... }, { ... }], {
  onConflictFields: ['email'], // specify a manual set of fields pass to the on conflict clause
  onConflictAction: 'merge',
  onConflictExcludeFields: ['id'],
});
```

This will generate query similar to the following:

```sql
insert into "author"
  ("id", "current_age", "email", "foo")
  values
    (1, 41, 'a1', true),
    (2, 42, 'a2', true),
    (5, 43, 'a3', true)
  on conflict ("email")
  do update set
    "current_age" = excluded."current_age",
    "foo" = excluded."foo"
  returning "_id", "current_age", "foo", "bar"
```

The `onConflictWhere` option allows you to add a WHERE clause to the conflict target, enabling conditional updates based on existing data. This is useful for scenarios like optimistic locking or version-based updates where you only want to update if certain conditions are met.

```ts
await em.upsert(Document, {
  name: 'doc1',
  version: 2,
  content: 'updated content',
}, {
  onConflictFields: ['name'],
  onConflictWhere: { version: { $lt: 2 } },
});
```

## Refreshing entity state

You can use `em.refresh(entity)` to synchronize the entity state with database. This is a shortcut for calling `em.findOne()` with `refresh: true` and disabled auto-flush.

> This results in loss of any changes done to that entity.

```ts
const author = await em.findOneOrFail(Author, { name: 'Jon' });
console.log(author.name); // 'Jon'

// changes to entity will be lost!
author.name = '123';

// refresh the value, ignore any changes
await em.refresh(author);
console.log(author.name); // 'Jon'
```

## Batch inserts, updates and deletes

When you flush changes made to one entity type, only one query per given operation (create/update/delete) will be executed.

```ts
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  const u = new User(`Peter ${i}`, `peter+${i}@foo.bar`);
  em.persist(u);
}

await em.flush();

// insert into `user` (`name`, `email`) values
//   ('Peter 1', 'peter+1@foo.bar'),
//   ('Peter 2', 'peter+2@foo.bar'),
//   ('Peter 3', 'peter+3@foo.bar'),
//   ('Peter 4', 'peter+4@foo.bar'),
//   ('Peter 5', 'peter+5@foo.bar');
```

```ts
for (const user of users) {
  user.name += ' changed!';
}

await em.flush();

// update `user` set
//   `name` = case
//     when (`id` = 1) then 'Peter 1 changed!'
//     when (`id` = 2) then 'Peter 2 changed!'
//     when (`id` = 3) then 'Peter 3 changed!'
//     when (`id` = 4) then 'Peter 4 changed!'
//     when (`id` = 5) then 'Peter 5 changed!'
//     else `priority` end
//   where `id` in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

```ts
em.remove(users);
await em.flush();

// delete from `user` where `id` in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

## Disabling identity map and change set tracking

Sometimes you might want to disable identity map and change set tracking for some query. This is possible via `disableIdentityMap` option. Behind the scenes, it will create new context, load the entities inside that, and clear it afterwards, so the main identity map will stay clean.

> As opposed to _managed_ entities, such entities are called _detached_. To be able to work with them, you first need to merge them via `em.merge()`.

```ts
const users = await em.find(User, { email: 'foo@bar.baz' }, {
  disableIdentityMap: true,
  populate: ['cars.brand'],
});
users[0].name = 'changed';
await em.flush(); // calling flush have no effect, as the entity is not managed
```

## Entity Repositories

Although you can use `EntityManager` directly, a more convenient way is to use [`EntityRepository` instead](https://mikro-orm.io/repositories/). You can register your repositories in dependency injection container like [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) so you do not need to get them from `EntityManager` each time.

For more examples, take a look at [`tests/EntityManager.mongo.test.ts`](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/blob/master/tests/EntityManager.mongo.test.ts) or [`tests/EntityManager.mysql.test.ts`](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/blob/master/tests/EntityManager.mysql.test.ts).

## Custom Property Ordering

Entity properties provide some support for custom ordering via the `customOrder` attribute. This is useful for values that have a natural order that doesn't align with their underlying data representation. Consider the code below, the natural sorting order would be `high`, `low`, `medium`. However, you can provide the `customOrder` to indicate how the enum values should be sorted.

```ts
enum Priority {
  Low = 'low',
  Medium = 'medium',
  High = 'high',
}

@Entity()
class Task {
  @PrimaryKey()
  id!: number

  @Property()
  label!: string

  @Enum({
    items: () => Priority,
    customOrder: [Priority.Low, Priority.Medium, Priority.High]
  })
  priority!: Priority
}

// ...

em.create(Task, { label: 'A', priority: Priority.Low }),
em.create(Task, { label: 'B', priority: Priority.Medium }),
em.create(Task, { label: 'C', priority: Priority.High })
await em.flush();

const tasks = await em.find(Task, {}, { orderBy: { priority: QueryOrder.ASC } });
for (const t of tasks) {
  console.log(t.label);
}
// Logs A, B, C
```

## Extending `EntityManager`

To extend the EntityManager with your own custom methods, you can use the `entityManager` ORM option:

```ts
import { MikroORM, EntityManager } from '@mikro-orm/sqlite';

class MyEntityManager extends EntityManager {

  myCustomMethod(base: number): number {
    return base * Math.random();
  }

}

const orm = await MikroORM.init({
  entities: [...],
  dbName: ':memory:',
  // highlight-next-line
  entityManager: MyEntityManager,
});
console.log(orm.em instanceof MyEntityManager); // true
const res = orm.em.myCustomMethod(123);
```
